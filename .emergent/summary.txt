**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
Upcoming Tasks:
- **Task 1: Market Research and Analysis (P0)**: The user wants a complete analysis of the project, including:
    - Researching the market to see if similar applications exist.
    - Analyzing this application's strengths and weaknesses.
    - Comparing it to competitors like Streamlabs OBS.
    - Providing a final expert opinion on its potential.
- **Task 2: End-to-End Testing (P1)**: The user wants a full test of all functionalities from an end-user perspective, with a special focus on ensuring all automated email notifications (registration verification, live stream alerts, leaderboard updates) are working correctly.

Future Tasks:
- **Task 1: YouTube API Integration (P2)**: The YouTube API integration is present but requires a valid  to be functional. The agent needs to ask the user for this key and then build out the frontend functionality to display the channel stats.
- **Task 2: Full Integration of 3rd Party Services (P2)**: While the backend APIs for Discord, OBS, and Streamlabs are in place, they require credentials and further frontend UI implementation to be fully usable from the admin panel.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Project Setup**: Replaced the initial boilerplate with the user's full-stack REMZA019 Gaming application from GitHub.
- **Version Restoration**: Located and restored a specific version from git history that included a functional trial and license key generation system (, ).
- **Theming System Fix**: Refactored  to use CSS variables for colors, fixing an issue where theme changes only affected the background animation.
- **Refactoring & Customization**: Removed hardcoded text from UI components and connected them to a backend customization API, making them editable from the admin panel.
- **Admin Authentication**: Implemented a global  for persistent admin login state.
- **Dynamic Stream Schedule**: Created a full CRUD API () and corresponding frontend widgets (, ) for managing stream schedules.
- **Distribution Mode**: Implemented a mode to hide admin controls for end-user distribution, toggleable via an environment variable and an admin setting.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion,  (translation), React Context API.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, Motor (async MongoDB driver), JWT (authentication).
-   **Database**: MongoDB.
-   **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for broadcasting theme changes and other real-time updates.
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack monorepo-style structure with a clear separation between frontend and backend. Modular backend API design.

**key DB schema**
  - : {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , }
  - : {, }
  - : {uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , }
  - : A single document storing key-value pairs for all UI text and settings (, , , , etc.).
  - : {, , , }

**changes in tech stack**
  - None. The project has consistently used the React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack.

**All files**
- Key files created/updated in this session:
  - : Major updates to integrate numerous API modules.
  - : Heavily modified to remove hardcoded text, add new components, and integrate state from various systems.
  - : Rewritten to use CSS variables for theming instead of hardcoded colors.
  - **New Backend APIs**: , , . Also copied in , , , .
  - **New Frontend Components**: , , , , .
  - **New Frontend Utils/Context**: , .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The agent has already removed a significant number of backup files, but a final check for any remaining  or unused files would be beneficial.
-  was noted to use local storage, while newer panels use the backend API. It might be worth refactoring it to use the backend API for consistency.

**key api endpoints**
- : Admin login.
- : GET/POST customization data for the UI.
- : Generates trial or full license keys.
- : Registers a new viewer.
- : Awards points to a viewer for an activity.
- : Gets the current viewer leaderboard.
- : CRUD endpoints for the stream schedule.
- , , : Endpoints for the newly integrated services.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The entire project was sourced from the user's GitHub repo, overwriting the initial template. Much of the work involved discovering, debugging, and integrating pre-existing but incomplete features from that repo.
- The project is being developed in distinct phases. The next logical steps are to complete the rebranding, conduct the market analysis requested by the user, and then perform a final E2E test.
- Several critical APIs (YouTube, Discord, OBS, Streamlabs) require API keys or tokens to be set in  to be fully functional. The agent should be prepared to ask the user for these credentials.

**documents created in this job**
  - None.
