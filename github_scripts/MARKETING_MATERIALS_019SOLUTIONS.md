• You manage content yourself (no developer needed)
• Fans donate directly (no 3rd-party fees)
• Looks professional AF

## EMAIL TEMPLATE #3: For Esports Organizations

**Subject:** Unified Web Presence for [ORG_NAME] Team

**Body:**

Hi [ORG MANAGER],

[ORG_NAME] has incredible talent, but each member lacks a professional web presence.

We built a **multi-tenant system** for gaming organizations:
• Unified branding for all team members
• Individual admin panels for each streamer
• Central dashboard for org management
• Payment routing (org gets % of donations)

Demo: https://deployed-app.preview.emergentagent.com

Perfect for:
✅ Esports teams
✅ Gaming collectives
✅ Talent agencies
✅ Content creator networks

Pricing: $299/mo for up to 10 members (vs. $30k+ for custom dev)

Schedule demo call: [CALENDLY LINK]

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
Head of Development, 019Solutions

## LINKEDIN OUTREACH MESSAGE

**Subject:** Professional Websites for Gaming Creators

**Message:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Noticed you work with gaming creators at [COMPANY]. Quick question:

How are your creators building their web presence beyond social media?

We built this for streamers: https://deployed-app.preview.emergentagent.com
(Custom CMS, payment integration, real-time updates)

Most streamers use Linktree ($0) or pay $50k+ for custom dev. We're in the middle ($15k-$50k one-time or $49-$99/mo SaaS).

Worth a quick chat to see if we could help your roster?

Thanks,
[YOUR NAME]
```

## REDDIT POST TEMPLATE (r/Twitch, r/streaming)

**Title:** [Showcase] Built a professional gaming website with custom admin CMS - REMZA019 Gaming

**Body:**
```
Hey r/Twitch!

I built a professional website for a gaming streamer friend (REMZA019) and thought I'd share for feedback.

🔗 Live site: https://deployed-app.preview.emergentagent.com

**Features:**
- Custom Admin Panel (streamer controls all content - no dev needed)
- Real-time YouTube integration (auto-syncs subscribers, live status)
- Multi-language support (English, Serbian, German)
- Payment integration (PayPal + Stripe)
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket, not polling)
- Mobile responsive (obviously)

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + Framer Motion
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + MongoDB
- APIs: YouTube Data API v3, Stripe, PayPal

**Why I built this:**
Most streamers either use Linktree (basic) or pay $50k+ for custom websites. This is the middle ground - professional, customizable, affordable.

Happy to answer questions about the tech or process!

(Not trying to sell anything, just sharing what I learned building this)

**Tweet 1:**
```
Built a professional gaming website for @remza019 with features 90% of streamers don't have 🧵

Most pros use Linktree or static pages. This has a custom CMS, real-time YouTube sync, and payment integration.

Demo: [LINK]
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Key features:
• Custom Admin Panel (no coding needed)
• YouTube Data API integration (auto-updates)
• Multi-language support (EN/SR/DE)
• WebSocket real-time updates
• PayPal + Stripe donations

Built with React + FastAPI
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Honestly surprised how few streamers have proper websites.

Even big names (100k+ followers) just link to social media.

If you're building a brand, you need a home base. Not a Linktree.

We're 019Solutions – we build these for gaming creators.
